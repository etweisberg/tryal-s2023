## Mission
Our mission is to accelerate medical research by empowering everyday people to get involved with research on their own terms. Tryal will be a personalized mobile platform to attract, encourage, and educate participants in order to expand the research recruiting pool while developing involved and eager participants. 

## Product
Our product functions like a job-search app, dating app or social media app, rather than a clinical trial website. Tryal is easy to use, customized to the userâ€™s preferences, quickly capable of matching users to suitable studies, and uses custom chat features to enhance the relationship between participant and researcher.

## Technology
We utilize the MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB as our database layer, Express and Node for our backend API, and React Native for the mobile client. We use Passport.js for authentication. We use React Native Paper for styling. We are also working on using Socket.IO for messaging.
